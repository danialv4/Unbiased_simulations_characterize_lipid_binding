All scripts call trajectories that have been previously centered using "trjconv.sh"

- "mindist.sh" is the script used to compute the minimum distance between protein and lipid
- "solv_time.sh" is the script used to compute the lipid tail solvation for each frame
- "volmap.sh" is the script used to compute the volumetric density maps, it calls the volmap*tcl scripts
- "xray_dist.sh" is the script used to compute the distance to the center of mass of the crystallographic ligands, it calls dist_xray*.tcl
- "com_entry.sh" is the script used to extract the COM of the lipid along the trajectory, for studying lipid entry
- "contacts.sh" is the script used to compute the contacts during the last 100 ns of the simulations
