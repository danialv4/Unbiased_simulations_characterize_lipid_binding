Final frames of the simulation of all protein-lipid pairs in the manuscript

In case variants/mutants of the same protein were simulated, they are located in separate folders

- The notation is FL for full-length and DX for delta-X
- Mutants are denoted as '_Mutant'

The intermediate files of the multiple lipid binding assay of ESYT-2, Atg2 Chorein, and Vps13 Chorein are provided,
with notation *2dop* for the final frame of the simulation with 2 lipids, *3dop" with 3 lipids, and so on

For the simulation of big BLTPs with multiple lipids, only the final structure is given
