Supporting DATA files for "Unbiased MD simulations characterize lipid binding to lipid transfer proteins"

Three different folders are provided:
- Workflow/ contains all the necessary files to run the unbiased lipid binding assay for any protein of interest,
including MDP files, GRO files of lipids, and the scripts with the protocol

- Analysis/ gathers multiple scripts used for the analysis of the resullts, such as lipid tail solvation

- Final_Frames/ contains the final frames of the simulations of all protein-lipid pairs in the manuscript
